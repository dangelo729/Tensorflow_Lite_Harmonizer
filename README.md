# Tensorflow_Lite_Harmonizer
A custom trained model for midi harmonization, deployed on the teensy 4.1 microcontroller. Undergoing active development. Machine learning code begins on line 511 of moon_man.h

Trained using the js-fakes midi dataset: https://github.com/omarperacha/js-fakes

Much thanks to Andrew Piepenbrink and his amazing thread on the teensy forum, which helped me get this project rolling:
